# Jupyter Notebook Documentation

Welcome to the Jupyter Notebook documentation site. Jupyter Notebook is
a lightweight notebook authoring application, and is a part of [Project
Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), a large umbrella project
centered around the goal of providing tools for interactive computing
with computational notebooks.

Computational notebook documents provide a way to explain code and tell
stories with data, by combining plain language descriptions, computer code,
data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and
interactive controls. The notebook paradigm is excellent for prototyping
code, exploratory data analysis, and providing interactive visualizations.

Jupyter Notebook is a sibling to other notebook authoring applications under
the Project Jupyter umbrella, like JupyterLab. Jupyter Notebook offers a
lightweight, simplified experience compared to JupyterLab.

Read more about how to use Jupyter Notebook on this site, in the [User
Documentation](user-documentation).
